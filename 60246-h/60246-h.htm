<h2 class="center"><span class="small"><span class="large"><i>Foreword</i></span></span></h2>
<p>In the Fall of 1940, Ernie Pyle and &ldquo;that girl&rdquo; who
rode with him (his wife, &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo;) came to Gatlinburg
and Ernie wrote eleven columns for the Scripps-Howard
Newspapers about the village of Gatlinburg, the native
people and a trip he took to LeConte.</p>
<p>With permission of the Scripps-Howard Newspaper
Alliance and Wm. Sloane Associates Inc., Publishers,
these columns are reproduced in this little booklet.</p>
<p>They are good reading&mdash;by one of the truly great
writers of our time. They are about things close to the
heart of all who love the Smokies. They are simple (as
is all great writing) sincere and touched by a quaint and
whimsical humor.</p>
<p>I wish to thank Loye W. Miller, Editor of the
Knoxville (Tennessee) News-Sentinel, and Bert Vincent,
Strolling Reporter, for their kind help and cooperation
in re-printing these columns.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Oct. 24, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>For four years I&rsquo;ve
been trying to get to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
and to write some masterful columns about the astounding manner
in which Nature splattered her contours and evolutions over this
part of the globe.</p>
<p>But I monkeyed around and monkeyed around, and the first
thing I knew here was President Roosevelt down here dedicating
the thing, and stealing all my glory.</p>
<p>But I just figured, well, the mountains are still here and the
words are still in the dictionary, so I might as well come on anyway
and compose a little deathless literature on the Smokies, even if
Mr. Roosevelt did beat me to the draw.</p>
<p>So here we are in Gatlinburg, the north entrance to the great
park. Gatlinburg once consisted of five families. But today, thanks
to tourist money, it is an amazingly charming little city, oozing
with handicraft shops and tasteful inns and lovely stone houses and
saddle horses and pretty girls in jodhpurs.</p>
<p>Gatlinburg lies in a cup, and low wooded mountains rise on
every side, and a little river runs behind the town, and the main
street goes a little uphill and around a couple of bends, and it is
all just like you&rsquo;d want a mountain resort to be.</p>
<p>Right now is the peak of the fall color season, and the mountains
are aflame with red and yellow and green, and anybody who
can see them without some kind of a gladness at being alive must
be a dull soul indeed.</p>
<h3 id="c2">PASSED BY TIME</h3>
<p>Centuries ago, white pioneers from England and Scotland came
into these mountains and set up their homes. They were so isolated
that our so-called progress largely passed them by.</p>
<p>They grew up to be a little race distinct. There is no denying
that a mountain man is different from a plains or city man. I can&rsquo;t
exactly tell you the difference, but there is something basically
rugged in his character that would be nice to have within yourself.</p>
<p>There are old men in these mountains who would feel embarrassed
and naked if the long rifle did not rest on its nails in the
wall. You can walk into the hills right behind Gatlinburg and still
hear even the children saying &ldquo;hit&rdquo; for &ldquo;it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;heerd&rdquo; for
&ldquo;heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can still find leather tanning in the homes, and weaving
and spinning, and people who make their own furniture, and think
it a sin to tend garden on Sundays.</p>
<p>It was to preserve a little of this for posterity, and also to open
up the magnificent scenery of the Smokies to the great taxpaying
public, that the Great Smokies National Park was created.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>It started in 1923, when the states of Tennessee and North
Carolina began buying mountain land from the big timber companies.
John D. Rockefeller Jr. played an important part. He
matched, dollar for dollar, every cent put up by the two states.</p>
<p>In 1926, Congress authorized the establishment of a Park. The
land already bought was turned over to the Federal Government,
and the Government itself bought more.</p>
<p>The National Park Service actually moved in and took charge
about 10 years ago. Today the park is well up among the older
western parks in the facilities it has created for the public, such as
roads, camp grounds, hiking and horse trails. As far as I can see,
every thing has been tastefully done. You have a feeling that the
park is &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year visitors to the park will run more than 800,000. It is
open all year, but summer and fall are the big seasons. In June, July
and August you can&rsquo;t even find a place to sleep in Gatlinburg if
you arrive late.</p>
<h3 id="c3">PARK IS OVAL SHAPE</h3>
<p>The Great Smokies Park is roughly 54 miles long and 19 miles
wide at the widest point. It is oval shaped. Except for a few high,
level pastures, it is tremendously rugged throughout its entirety.
It has 16 peaks more than 6000 feet high.</p>
<p>Vegetation is lush, clear to the top of the highest peak. There
is no timberline in these mountains. Balsam and spruce grow thick
in the upper regions. In summer the rainfall is almost tropical, and
in winter heavy snows blanket the trees and slopes into a fairyland.</p>
<p>Almost constantly a gray haze hangs like a thin veil over the
pile after pile of far, high, ridges. That is why these mountains are
called The Smokies. They say that no one knows for sure what
causes this haze, but one explanation credits it to tiny particles of
moisture rising from the heavily-soaked vegetation.</p>
<p>The park is half in Tennessee and half in North Carolina. The
high, sharp backbone of the Smokies cuts the park in two, and along
this backbone runs the state line. A horse trail follows this backbone
the length of the Park, but there is no motor road up there.</p>
<p>A fine macadam highway crosses the Park, from Gatlinburg
to Cherokee, on the Carolina side. And a few gravel roads stab short
distances into the hills from several entrances.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the public must take to foot or horseback to
see the vast, beckoning interior of the Park. And since taking to
foot is one of life&rsquo;s accomplishments which I am most prodigious
at, to coin a phrase, we shall take to foot in a Herculean way about
tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">MT. LE CONTE LODGE, Great Smokies Park, Oct. 25, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>When I go to see a National Park, I like to walk in it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to mope along with a tourist party behind a
naturalist, and I don&rsquo;t want to ride no damned horse. I just want
to get out all by myself like a hermit and square off my shoulders
and head uphill.</p>
<p>There is plenty of walking for a fellow like me in the Great
Smokies. In fact there are 675 miles of trails that meander all over
this vast park.</p>
<p>But the main trails patronized by tourists are the five different
routes which lead up to the top of Mt. Le Conte, nearly 6600 feet
high. Many people make it up and back in one day. But others, like
myself add 95 per cent to the pleasure by staying on top all night.</p>
<p>People had told me the Alum Cave trail was the prettiest and
most spectacular. So, the day before starting, I went over to Park
Headquarters to inquire and get my bearings.</p>
<p>I wound up talking to Assistant Chief Ranger Harold Edwards.
He wears a uniform and has a desk and lots of papers on it, so I
believed every word he said.</p>
<p>He said it would take me five hours to climb the Alum Cave
trail. He said it would be the longest five and a half miles I ever
walked. He said it was very steep, and footing irregular.</p>
<p>Well, it is possible I misunderstood Ranger Edwards, but I
doubt it. Also it is possible that I&rsquo;m a better man than I thought.
But that seems somewhat fantastic, since I think I&rsquo;m practically
perfect to start with. So I can only deduce that Ranger Edwards,
in spite of being a nice fellow, simply has days when he isn&rsquo;t all
there.</p>
<p>For, instead of five hours, I was on top of Mt. Le Conte in
two hours and 50 minutes. And since I had prepared myself for a
terrible ordeal, it seemed like the shortest five and a half miles I
ever walked. It was, in fact, smooth and nice all the way up.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Edwards. I guess he meant well, but he just didn&rsquo;t
realize he was talking with one of the mountain-climbingest goats
this side of Tibet.</p>
<h3 id="c5">BACK TO SLEEP</h3>
<p>In preparation for this historic stroll I awoke at 7 a.m., yawned
a couple of times, and went back to sleep for half an hour. Then I
ate breakfast, read the morning paper, got those old gray pants
out of the back of the car and, as a final gesture, put them on.</p>
<p>Also I filled up the little chamois pack sack which That Girl
made for my gallant walk through the Rockies last year from the
United States to Canada.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>In this pack sack I put an extra sweater, four hankerchiefs
(because I still have a cold), an extra pair of socks, two Hershey
bars, two oranges, an old ham sandwich, and an extra pack of
cigarettes, in case my wind gave out.</p>
<p>I did not take my sun glasses, nor a camera, nor a bottle of
water, nor a ten-pound toilet kit, nor my new tuxedo, since past
experience as an Alpinist has shown that such things are all a lot
of nonsense.</p>
<p>It was 9:20 a.m. when I stepped out of Ranger Edwards&rsquo; car,
shook hands, and, without once looking back, plunged into the
jungle. Exciting experiences were not long in coming.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t gone 200 yards when I came upon two couples standing
in the trail, talking. They didn&rsquo;t see me coming, so I had to
walk around them. As I did so one woman said, &ldquo;Oh excuse me,&rdquo;
and I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifty yards farther on I came upon a man with a cane, sitting
against a tree. He said, &ldquo;Are those people still gabbing back there?&rdquo;
and I said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had been walking an hour and a half, I met two
young men coming down the trail like rockets. We stopped and
smoked a cigarette together. They had walked clear to the top already
this morning, and were well on their way back down, and it
was now only 10:45. It was then I began to smell a mouse in
Mr. Edwards&rsquo; sinister warnings about the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far along am I?&rdquo; I asked. It was my impression I was
barely getting started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re half way there,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the trail ahead, how is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No steeper than you&rsquo;ve come over,&rdquo; they said. By that time
Mr. Edwards&rsquo; mouse smelled real bad. But I was glad, too, for if
there&rsquo;s one thing I like about a mountain trail it&rsquo;s for there not
to be much more of it. I lunged on, and disappeared around a bend.</p>
<h3 id="c6">DISTANCES DECEPTIVE</h3>
<p>At 12 o&rsquo;clock sharp, I came around another bend and there
ahead, across a valley stood a sharp precipice. They had told me
that right behind this precipice lay the Le Conte Lodge.</p>
<p>I stood a minute, and tried to judge how long it would take
to get there. Distances in the mountains are very deceptive. Out
West you can see a long way, hence an actual distance is much
farther than it looks. I remember once, in the high Rockies, figuring
it would take an hour to get to a certain ridge, but it actually took
three hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>So with this in mind, I estimated one hour to get to this
precipice. And shiver these old timbers, if I wasn&rsquo;t there in 10
minutes. The climb was over, and I hadn&rsquo;t even eaten my sandwich.</p>
<p>Just as I topped the ridge, I turned around in the direction of
Park Headquarters, and looked far down toward where Ranger
Edwards was probably nestling behind his desk, and I puckered up
my mouth and said, &ldquo;Five hours Pvvvvvvtt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;And now that I&rsquo;ve used up this whole column bragging
on myself, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to get to work tomorrow and tell you
what I saw on the trip. Hope I can think of something good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">MT. LE CONTE LODGE, Great Smokies Park, Oct. 26, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>This Le Conte Lodge, they say, is the highest mountain lodge east
of the Rockies. It stands at 6400 feet. With one exception, it is the
only place within the boundaries of the Great Smokies National
Park where you can stay all night. And the only way to get up
here is to walk or ride a horse.</p>
<p>The Lodge is open about seven months of the year. In winter
it gets to 40 below up here, and the buildings lie deep in snow. The
hottest they remember it being in summertime is 68, and the people
who work here get so used to cool summers that they almost die
when they go down to the valley heat of Gatlinburg, a mile below.</p>
<p>The lodge can put up 44 people. They charge $4 a day for
room and two meals. In the three mid-summer months the place
is full every night. But right now there aren&rsquo;t so many. Unless
somebody shows up late, I will be the lone guest tonight.</p>
<p>In the old days up here, all the beds were of balsam boughs.
City fellers who walked up the mountain could go back home and
tell of sleeping on a bed of brush and limbs.</p>
<p>But now this is a National Park, and you can&rsquo;t even cut a twig
from a tree. So visitors have to be content with nice modern mattresses
and Hudson&rsquo;s Bay blankets.</p>
<p>Some amazing people have walked into Le Conte Lodge. One
94-year-old man climbed the mountain on foot. An 83-year-old
woman came up under her own steam. And another man past 80
walked up alone, got caught by darkness within 200 yards of the
Lodge but didn&rsquo;t know where he was, so lay down on the ground
and slept all night. He walked on in after daylight, feeling fine.</p>
<h3 id="c8">BEARS DON&rsquo;T HIDE</h3>
<p>But let me tell you about my walk up the mountain. On the
Alum Cave trail, by which I came, there is no place where you walk
along an actual precipice that drops off straight down for thousands
of feet. But I can say that if you are up here, and should suddenly
find yourself in desperate need of a precipice, there are some places
that would serve as excellent substitutes.</p>
<p>The first part of the trip, in the lower altitudes, is deep in a
forest of trees and bushes. Rhododendron roots make a tangle that
is absolutely tropical. You can&rsquo;t see 10 feet into it, and this is where
the bears used to hide when hunters got after them.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no hunting in the park now, so the bears
don&rsquo;t have to hide any more. The bears in the Smokies are black
bears, a little smaller and a little faster on the bite than the Yellowstone
bears.</p>
<p>The favorite bear story around here is about the woman tourist
who got bit on her behind. She was just getting into her car after
taking pictures of some cubs, when Mama Bear ran up and bit the
lady right where she sits down. It made a gash three inches long
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and an inch and a half deep. The doctor who tended it said it was
a good thing the lady was fat.</p>
<p>They say there are at least 600 black bears in the park. But
hikers on the trails needn&rsquo;t worry about them. They&rsquo;re not like the
Yellowstone bears. They&rsquo;ll run as soon as they see you. And if
they don&rsquo;t, I will.</p>
<h3 id="c9">STARES AT BEAUTY</h3>
<p>After an hour and a half of walking, I had risen above the
matted rhododendron vines, risen away from the bounding little
rock-bedded mountain stream, risen to heights where the trail
came out from among the trees and one could stand and look forever.</p>
<p>And it was then I realized for the first time in my life, that
there can be as much majesty and stirring beauty in Eastern mountains
as in the Rockies.</p>
<p>Many times on the trail I just stopped and stared and stared.
I don&rsquo;t know that I have ever seen a lovelier sight than the onward-stretching
undulations of the haze-softened and color-splashed immensities
of the Great Smoky Mountains.</p>
<h3 id="c10">WATCHED SQUIRRELS</h3>
<p>Once, deep in the woods, I sat down on a rock to rest. It was
quiet as the grave, and I had the feeling that I might almost have
been the first man here.</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard a rattling in the trees. It startled me at first,
and then I saw a flash of movement, and realized it was a squirrel
running down a tree trunk.</p>
<p>I sat there real still. Soon there was another squirrel. And then
another. They were odd little fellows&mdash;only half as big as the ordinary
squirrel. Later I learned the mountain people call them
&ldquo;boomers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of them walked a fallen log right up to within six feet
of me, and sat there on his haunches, eating and staring.</p>
<p>I gave a little whistle. He stared harder. Then I whistled again.
And several more times. And maybe you think I didn&rsquo;t feel silly,
and a little thrilled, too, when a bird started answering me. Yessir.
I&rsquo;d whistle, and the bird would whistle right back. It made me feel
like Audubon or Thoreau or somebody.</p>
<p>That went on for five minutes. But finally I had to go. So I
got up and said, &ldquo;To hell with you, you lousy little squirrels and
birds, you&rsquo;d probably eat me up if you had a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any savage squirrel that attacks me will get the toe of my boot
right where he sits down, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;ll get. No squirrel is going
to eat me up. I got up to the top of the mountain without anything
else happening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">LE CONTE LODGE, Great Smokies Park, Oct. 28, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>Jack Huff is a mountain man. All of his 30-odd years have been
spent here in the Smokies. And for 17 of those years he has been
the entrepreneur at the top of Mt. Le Conte.</p>
<p>He owns the Le Conte Lodge. Seven months of the year he
feeds and beds and maybe entertains the hikers and horsemen who
come up the trail.</p>
<p>Jack Huff was just out of high school when he first came to
the top of Mt. Le Conte, and he had visions of building a mountaintop
tent camp for hiking vacationers. That was long before there
was even a horse trail up here. Everything that came up had to come
on men&rsquo;s backs.</p>
<p>Today three pack horses arrive every afternoon loaded with
supplies, and the lodge consists of a whole row of cabins, and two
small log lodges, and a big house for the Huffs&rsquo; own living quarters.
And Jack is still building.</p>
<p>Jack Huff seems timid at first, but he really enjoys talking to
people if he likes them. They say he can size up a new arrival in
ten seconds. If the new arrival is a heel, Jack Huff is polite but his
conversation becomes a minimum.</p>
<p>Few vacationers can out-think this product of the Smokies. He
listens nightly to the radio news; he absorbs scores of passionate
orations on world affairs from his guests before the big fireplace;
he reads the papers and magazines.</p>
<p>He is a man of many abilities, too. He builds his own cabins,
he has a flair for architecture; construction is his hobby. And he
weaves. On the big loom in the dining room he has woven all the
lovely curtains for the lodge windows.</p>
<p>He got his weaving, among other things, from the Pi Phi
Settlement School down in Gatlinburg. That is a school founded 28
years ago by the college sorority, to bring a better education to the
mountaineers. Pretty Pi Phis come from all over to teach there.</p>
<p>A girl named Pauline Whaling came down from the north, to
teach the mountaineers. She was out of Monmouth College in Illinois,
and Northwestern University.</p>
<p>But whether she taught, or got taught, I can&rsquo;t quite decide. For
she married Jack Huff, and came to the mountain with him. And
when their little boy was born, he came to the mountain too&mdash;a
husky, tow headed example of a good life.</p>
<p>For seven years Pauline Whaling has been on the mountain,
working with her own hands, helping run things. She is beautiful
in her heavy boots and leather jacket.</p>
<p>She leaps around the terrace of the lodge like a gazelle. She
was up at 4 this morning to see Jack off on an early trip down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
mountain. She herself has hiked the tough eight-mile Newfound
Gap trail in two hours flat. She is bountifully happy. &ldquo;Up here is
peace,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>A mountaineer&rsquo;s strength is in his heart, and not necessarily
in a big body. Jack Huff weighs only 150 pounds, and stands sort
of folded up with his hands in his pockets. But his walking feats
are astounding.</p>
<p>He has walked 15,000 miles up and down this mountainside.
He kept count of his round trips until three years ago, and at that
time they had passed 1000. It is seven miles each way, and exactly
a mile gained in altitude.</p>
<p>He has often made two round trips in one day, packing great
loads up the trail on his back. There are some mighty men in these
mountains. Listen to this story:</p>
<p>Andy Huff is Jack&rsquo;s father. He owns the big Mountain View
Hotel down in Gatlinburg. He has lived down there for 40 years,
but he has never seen his son&rsquo;s lodge up here, although it&rsquo;s only
two hours by horseback. &ldquo;I just haven&rsquo;t got time to go,&rdquo; says Andy
Huff.</p>
<p>But Jack&rsquo;s mother saw Le Conte Lodge before she died. She
made one trip. Just one. That trip sounds like a legend, but it&rsquo;s
true. She came up on her son&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>It was 14 years ago. Mrs. Huff was a semi-invalid. She wanted
to see the sunset from the peak before she died.</p>
<p>So Jack made a light wooden chair. He put arms on it for her,
and a board rest for her feet. He put her in it; they lifted her onto
his back, and ran the straps over his shoulders. Mrs. Huff weighed
90 pounds. In her lap she carried a kitten.</p>
<p>Jack Huff, packing his mother on his back, made those seven
miles to the top of Mt. Le Conte in exactly five hours. He stopped
only a few times, and that was for his mother to rest, rather than
him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only person who ever came up the mountain backwards,&rdquo;
he says. They still talk about it with awe around Gatlinburg.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huff stayed a week on the mountain, in a tent. But it
rained all the time. She never saw the sunset. Finally the dampness
became too much for her. One afternoon Jack wrapped her in a
raincoat, put her into her chair, and packed her back down the
mountain.</p>
<p>Soon after that he started building a log cabin for her, so she
would have a drier place to stay the next time. But she didn&rsquo;t live
to see it.</p>
<p>That old cabin is the original house of today&rsquo;s Le Conte Lodge.
Jack would like to keep it, for sentiment. But he says it isn&rsquo;t built
right, and soon it will have to come down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Oct. 29, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon,
while Jack Huff and I were sitting in front of the fireplace at the
top of Mt. Le Conte, a couple of weary strangers came around the
corner of the lodge.</p>
<p>They asked for succor&mdash;for a night&rsquo;s lodging and a spot of
food and a touch of bandage for sore heels&mdash;and they got it, in
good Smoky Mountain fashion.</p>
<p>They turned out to be two of the nicest strangers who ever
came to a mountaintop. They were Cleveland business men, out on
a vacation trip. One was John F. Wilson, white-haired general
manager of the Equity Savings &amp; Loan Co. The other was Carr
Liggett, who has his own advertising agency.</p>
<p>A man who has just climbed a mountain feels a wonderful
sense of accomplishment. He takes off his shoes and sprawls out
with a feeling of honestly earned repose. The thin air and the great
height and the unbridgeable gap in character between us and all
those soft souls down below gives you a puffy pride, and you expand
and expound at great length. We all did that.</p>
<p>The afternoon wore on into early mountain darkness, and after
supper we felt like purring. Then Jack Huff came with more great
logs. And we sat warm before the fireplace and under the hanging
gasoline lantern and we all waxed, you might say, a little philosophic.</p>
<p>We finished the war (England won); we finished the election
(we&rsquo;re keeping the result secret); we wrapped up and shipped off
the WPA; we scouted the Andes and climbed a bit around the
Alps; we discussed the proper way to drive an automobile; we went
through the entire curriculum of sectional dialects in America; we
achieved a new definition of civilization as meaning the advance of
human kindness, and decided civilization is going ahead despite
everything; we told stories of bears and prodigious feats of walking;
we decided how a fireplace should be built; we took up the
Negro question and we talked of bank loans; we poured some
steel and we figured out the best way to build an air force. It&rsquo;s
astounding what a half-dozen people can talk about in one evening
on a mountaintop.</p>
<p>And then, as sort of dessert for our ruminations, Mr. Wilson
carried us back to pioneer days, when our hardy ancestors first came
to this country.</p>
<p>And so soothing were the bandages on Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s feet, and
so heady the wine of warmth upon Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s brow, that he
condemned all modern conveniences as a lot of nonsense. As for
him, he&rsquo;d take the pioneer way of cold bedrooms and candlelight
and straw ticks. Those were the days, and those were the men, said
Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>And in climactic conclusion, Mr. Wilson declaimed that of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the abominations upon this earth the most despicable in his life
was steam heat.</p>
<p>Whereupon we all retired to our cold bedrooms. If Mr. Wilson
had got up this morning swearing he had slept like a baby, I think
I would have kicked his sore heel. But he didn&rsquo;t. He damn near
froze to death, just as I did. Pioneers&mdash;Bah.</p>
<h3 id="c13">BREAKFAST EXCELLENT</h3>
<p>But the morning sun can do much for a man. Today was clear,
and our breakfast was excellent, and we faced the prospect of our
seven-mile return hike almost with eagerness.</p>
<p>Since I like to walk alone, I started out ahead of my new
friends. Twice during the first half of the downhill journey I
stopped to rest. But after the second sitting, I never stopped again.</p>
<p>The truth is, I was afraid to stop. That rheumatic knee of mine
got worse and worse. Every downward step plunged it into a kettle
of hot agony. It creaked so loud I couldn&rsquo;t hear the birds sing. It
went back and forth through sheer force of habit, and I knew that
if ever I interrupted its rhythmic routine to rest, I&rsquo;d never get it
started again.</p>
<p>So on and on I walked, through an eternity, and it was close
to noon when suddenly the forest-roofed trail broke out into the
open, and some cars were sitting around, and I knew here was the
end of the rainbow. The Great Walker had made it home. He
collapsed on a rock.</p>
<p>Now my Cleveland friends should have been no more than
five minutes behind. But time passed. And more time. And they
didn&rsquo;t come. Finally I got to worrying, and thinking of bears or
snakes or broken legs.</p>
<p>At last&mdash;three-quarters of an hour behind me&mdash;they came,
limping and halt.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s toes somehow had got all mixed up with each
other, and wound up a mass of blood inside his boots. And Mr.
Liggett discovered he had some muscles that hadn&rsquo;t been used since
he was marching down roads in France in 1918. We were, as they
say in the South, a &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; trio.</p>
<p>It is with a breaking heart that I recount this, for I believe Mr.
Wilson intends to tell some heroic story about it around Cleveland.
But I say this is a democracy, and if my own frail knee must suffer
the cruel scrutiny of the public spotlight, then Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s torn
toes shall not hide in privacy.</p>
<h3 id="c14">BID ADIEU</h3>
<p>We bid each other a hikers&rsquo; adieu. My Cleveland friends
started right home. Personally I&rsquo;m not at all sure of them, even
though Mr. Wilson is a rugged pioneer. If they do not return soon,
I hope The Cleveland Press will send out an expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As for me&mdash;well, don&rsquo;t you worry about me, folks, I&rsquo;m safe
and happy right here in bed with a hot pad around my knee. If
anybody should care to hire me to pack something back up the
mountain tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll consider it for a million dollars. Not very
seriously, though.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Oct. 30, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>Nearly a million tourists
a year are now coming to see the wonders of the Great Smoky
Mountains. But I&rsquo;ll bet not one in 1000 ever finds out anything
about the greatest wonder of all&mdash;and that is the people of Gatlinburg.</p>
<p>Gatlinburg is unique, there&rsquo;s no question about it. Ten years
ago it had a population of 75, and the mountain people just scraped
along from one meal to the next.</p>
<p>Today Gatlinburg, thanks to tourists, has a population of 1300
and is rolling in wealth. And what is unique about it&mdash;and delightful
too&mdash;is that the money is going into the pockets of the old
original families here, who for so long had almost nothing.</p>
<p>There are now approximately 40 business establishments in
town. At least half of them are owned within four families. They
are families that have been here for generations. And of the other
half, not more than half a dozen are owned by outsiders.</p>
<p>Many a slick fellow has arrived here, expecting to buy out
these easy marks for nothing or sign them up on a trick lease. But
in every case, they say, the smart fellow has left town without his
own shirt.</p>
<p>The surprising thing about this whole evolution is two-fold:</p>
<p>1&mdash;That the local people had the shrewdness to hold on to
things.</p>
<p>2&mdash;That they had the ability themselves, with almost no experience,
to do the necessary job of building for and satisfactorily
serving a million tourists a year.</p>
<p>The answer to the first is fundamental. It lies in the mountain
man&rsquo;s absolute refusal to give up his land. Money as such doesn&rsquo;t
mean much to a mountain man. It is land that he values, and craves.
Once he has land, he won&rsquo;t give it up.</p>
<p>As a consequence, outsiders can&rsquo;t buy land in Gatlinburg. No
matter what they offer, the mountain man says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
sell. I wouldn&rsquo;t have no place to pasture my cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to the second is simply that the mountain men of
Tennessee are smart. You can&rsquo;t make anything else out of it.
They&rsquo;re just natively smart, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<h3 id="c16">FIVE FAMILIES DOMINATE</h3>
<p>If you go up into the old graveyard on the hillside just back
of town, you&rsquo;ll find at least half the names on the gravestones divided
among five families. Those families are&mdash;Ogle, Whaley,
Maples, Reagan and Huff. The first four have been here for generations.
The Huffs came 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Four of these five families control Gatlinburg. They reap most
of the profit, and they likewise take the responsibility and do the
good deeds.</p>
<p>There are four key business establishments in Gatlinburg. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
are the three big hotels and the huge general store. The Ogles own
the store. And the Huffs, Whaleys and Maples each own a hotel.
And every one of the four, in addition owns numerous tourist
courts, filling stations, gift shops, saddle-horse concessions, restaurants.</p>
<p>These four families, working together, competing but friendly,
have been almost super-wise in their development of Gatlinburg.</p>
<p>Their building has been tasteful. Largely inexperienced in
running hotels, they have created three delightful places.</p>
<p>And wisest of all, they haven&rsquo;t taken unfair advantage of the
flood of tourist gold which has descended upon them. They aren&rsquo;t
killing their golden geese. They have deliberately agreed among
themselves to keep prices down.</p>
<p>Hotel rates in Gatlinburg are amazingly low. At such prices
you&rsquo;d expect shoddy service and poor rooms. But everything is
modern, clean and pleasant.</p>
<h3 id="c17">HAVE SENSE OF HONESTY</h3>
<p>The hotels are staffed by local mountain people, and they have
pride and friendliness, clear down to the lowliest charwoman, that
wouldn&rsquo;t permit them to do a shoddy job.</p>
<p>Tourists support almost every one of the 1300 people in Gatlinburg.
Nobody is out of work who wants to work. Even the
people out in the hills live off the tourists, through their weaving,
basketry and woodwork.</p>
<p>We have been in most of the &ldquo;faddy&rdquo; places and big tourist
centers in America. In not one of them have we seen the plums
fall into the laps of the old-time residents of the place. Gatlinburg
is the only exception.</p>
<p>Why, it&rsquo;s just as though fame and millions of people were suddenly
to descend upon our crossroads in Indiana. And instead of
financiers from Chicago grabbing everything, my Dad would put
up a fine hotel, and Harry Bales would build a three-story gift
shoppe, and Doc Sturm would create six big tourist courts, and
Claud Lockeridge would own all restaurants, filling stations and
sight-seeing busses. And we&rsquo;d all get richer than hell.</p>
<p>Fame, please come to Indiana and make us farmers rich.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Oct. 31, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who has been
to Hawaii knows about &ldquo;The Big Five.&rdquo; How these five old families
control most everything in Hawaii. It is one of the tightest, and
also in my opinion one of the best monopolies in the world.</p>
<p>Well, Gatlinburg is just like Hawaii in that respect. There are
five leading families here. Four of these families hold the reins.
The fifth, although old and numerous and doing all right, could
not be considered a member of the &ldquo;control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Gatlinburg it could be called &ldquo;The Big Four.&rdquo; Let me tell
you about these families.</p>
<h3 id="c19">OGLES ARE OLDEST</h3>
<p>Ogle&mdash;They, I think, are probably the oldest. An Ogle started
the first store here, back before the Civil War. The Ogles have
ways been the merchants of the Smokies.</p>
<p>Charlie Ogle is the head Ogle today, and he runs the general
store that is one of the sights of Gatlinburg.</p>
<p>As business grew they kept building on more additions. The
store rambles and juts around all over the place. It has separate
grocery, shoe, hardware, women&rsquo;s-wear departments.</p>
<p>You can buy things here you can&rsquo;t get even in Knoxville&mdash;provided
Charlie, or his son, Earl, can locate them. They say you
can get anything here from a hairpin to a threshing machine.</p>
<p>So I put them to the test. I asked if they had &ldquo;G. Washington&rdquo;
coffee, which is the powdered kind you just stir into a cup of hot
water. That Girl carries it so she can have her morning coffee in
hotel rooms. Not one grocery in ten has it, we&rsquo;ve found.</p>
<p>But Ogle&rsquo;s came through. They had it all right.</p>
<h3 id="c20">WHALEYS OWN PLENTY</h3>
<p>Whaley&mdash;The Whaleys too have been here a long time. Steve
Whaley is the head man of the family. One son manages the hotel.
Another son manages the tourist court. There is also a filling station
in the family, and a saddle-horse concession, and they rent out
nearly half a block of business buildings.</p>
<p>I was talking to one of the Whaley boys of my pleasure in
seeing the rich harvestings from the tourist crop kept in local hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I think we deserve it. We&rsquo;ve always been
poor and had to scratch. It wasn&rsquo;t many years ago that I was hoeing
corn right where the hotel stands now. We always had enough to
eat, like most farmers do, but we never had any money to get any
of the things we wanted. I think it&rsquo;s right that we have some of
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c21">THE MAPLES FAMILY</h3>
<p>Maples&mdash;There are two brothers of the older Maples generation.
One is Squire I. L. Maples, who once owned a store (I don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
know how the Ogles allowed that) and was once postmaster. The
other brother is David Crockett Maples. They are direct descendants
of the famous Davy Crockett, who died a hero in the Texas
Alamo.</p>
<p>Davy Crockett Maples was a rural mail carrier. He carried the
mail up into the higher Smokies, to Sugarlands, and the little way-back
settlements.</p>
<p>He is retired now. He hasn&rsquo;t much to do with his time. So he
uses it up milking a cow. He has one cow, and they say she gives
about a pint of milk. But neither hail nor sleet nor dark of night
stays Davy Crockett on his daily rounds to milk that beloved cow.</p>
<p>Rel Maple is Davy Crockett&rsquo;s son. He owns the Gatlinburg
Inn, the newest of the town&rsquo;s hotels. He also owns the Log Cabin
Cafe, and a gift shop, and there is a tourist court in the family.
The Maples are doing real well.</p>
<h3 id="c22">ANDY HUFF</h3>
<p>Huff&mdash;Andy Huff is Gatlinburg&rsquo;s most prominent man. He is
the civic leader. He starts things, and finishes them. What he suggests,
the other three usually do.</p>
<p>Andy Huff came to Gatlinburg 39 years ago from Greene
County, in Tennessee. He was a lumber man. He owned big saw-mills
and cut timber.</p>
<p>In the old days there wasn&rsquo;t any place around here for a
stranger to stay, so Andy Huff put up wayfarers at his house. But
the lumber men who stayed with the Huffs liked it so well they&rsquo;d
bring friends. That got to the point where they couldn&rsquo;t all get in
the Huff house.</p>
<p>So in 1916 Andy Huff built a frame hotel, which looked like a
house, just to accommodate the lumber men. He has been in the
hotel business ever since.</p>
<p>The old-time visitors to Gatlinburg always stayed with Andy
Huff at his Mountain View Hotel. But it is no longer an amateur
affair. It is a huge place, sitting on a hillside, and they have served
as many as 900 meals in a day there.</p>
<p>These four families are numerous with children, as mountain
families usually are. As each family&rsquo;s wealth grows, it is invested in
some new business for one of the children.</p>
<p>Mountain children do go away, but somehow they always come
back. The Huffs, the Ogles, the Whaleys, the Maples&mdash;each one has
a generation in its 20s and 30s, and they are all in the family business
up to their necks.</p>
<p>Almost without exception, they carry in their hearts the mountain
man&rsquo;s love of the land. And as long as that lasts, the &ldquo;Big
Four&rdquo; of Gatlinburg will endure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Nov. 1, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>Uncle Steve Whaley is
probably the most engaging man in Gatlinburg. He has always lived
here; always been a farmer and a trader.</p>
<p>He raised a big family here on the Little Pigeon River, in good
mountain fashion. And then, in his middle years, the irresistible
flood of human events rolled through the Great Smoky Mountains
and tinged everybody&rsquo;s life with change and Uncle Steve&rsquo;s life
changed too.</p>
<p>Today he is a power in these parts. He owns a big hotel, and
lots of other things. He is a business magnate. He is the elder Morgan
of his clan. His children are at the steering wheel, but I suspect
that Uncle Steve drives relentlessly from the back seat.</p>
<p>We are staying in Uncle Steve&rsquo;s hotel&mdash;the Riverside. It is
managed by his son Dick. Uncle Steve just wanders around and
about. Sometimes tourists stop out front and ask him if this is a
good hotel. He&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been staying here for quite a spell,
and I like it all right.&rdquo; He never tells them he owns it.</p>
<p>When Uncle Steve first was badgered into setting up a tourist
camp, he swore to all the family that it would be the end of the
Whaleys and all they&rsquo;d slaved for and saved.</p>
<p>But in the first year it made so much money that Uncle Steve
built a frame hotel, and this made so much money he built a big
modern hotel, and it&rsquo;s making so much money they&rsquo;re putting on
an addition this winter. It&rsquo;s hard telling where the thing will stop.</p>
<h3 id="c24">UNCLE STEVE DRY AND DROLL</h3>
<p>Uncle Steve is dry and droll. He&rsquo;s dumb like a fox, and old
fashioned like fluid drive. He&rsquo;s about as skinny as I am, and his
nose hangs over at the end like Puck&rsquo;s. He sort of halfway grins
when he talks, and his humor is so left-handed you don&rsquo;t know
half the time whether he&rsquo;s joking or not.</p>
<p>He loves to talk about being an ignorant hillbilly. It gets
funnier and funnier as it gradually dawns on you how all-fired
smart Uncle Steve really is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was educated at Bear Pen Holler University,&rdquo; he says. That
is his name for the School of Experience. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo;
about nothin&rsquo;, very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a local townsman asks him the population of Gatlinburg, or
the number of tourist cabins here, or who plans to do what, Uncle
Steve always says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; And he says it in a tone which
implies, &ldquo;Why you askin&rsquo; me, you know I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll bet there isn&rsquo;t a minor item about anything that is or
ever was in Gatlinburg that Uncle Steve doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know no more about runnin&rsquo; a hotel now than when
I started, and I didn&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; then,&rdquo; says Uncle Steve. &ldquo;All I
know is you cook and make the beds&mdash;and charge &rsquo;em a little.&rdquo;
That seems to me a pretty good basis to start on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never kept a book in my life,&rdquo; Uncle Steve says. &ldquo;I never
kept no track of how much I spent or how much I took in.&rdquo; He
apparently has stopped talking. You&rsquo;re just ready to reply, or
change the subject. And then finally, as a small afterthought, Uncle
Steve looks over at you slantlike and says in a low voice, &ldquo;I always
come out a little ahead though.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c25">POCKETS TIPS</h3>
<p>Uncle Steve still is known to carry up a tourist&rsquo;s bag occasionally,
and pocket the tip. He doesn&rsquo;t do it for a joke either. When
the tourists later find out who he is, they&rsquo;re rattled about having
tipped him. It doesn&rsquo;t rattle Uncle Steve though.</p>
<p>They tell how he got appendicitis a few years ago and went
to Knoxville to be operated on. At the hospital, they took down
his financial history before operating. They asked what he did,
and he said he worked for an old widow woman over at Gatlinburg
who ran a boarding house. Didn&rsquo;t get nothin&rsquo; for it, just
worked for his room and board. A price, in accordance, was agreed
upon for the operation.</p>
<p>But when Uncle Steve began to convalesce, the doctors began
to be flabbergasted. For here came a stream of the most astounding
visitors to see this old man&mdash;Knoxville hotel managers, bank
presidents, big politicians, land owners, Government officials. The
doctors began to smell a mouse, and then they really investigated.
But it was too late. He had already paid his bill.</p>
<p>Often older people bore you to death. But when we&rsquo;re downstairs
we kind of keep peeking around hoping Uncle Steve will
come and sit with us. And very often he does.</p>
<h3 id="c26">WENT TO SEE ANDY HUFF</h3>
<p>One night he and I went up to see Andy Huff, who owns the
big Mountain View Hotel. They are direct competitors, but they&rsquo;re
old friends too. We sat and gabbed with Andy for an hour or so,
and then Andy drove us home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you standing the cooking down at the Riverside?&rdquo; Andy
Huff asked me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well the cooking&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but the owner
kind of gets on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Andy Huff. &ldquo;When you get all you
can stand of it, check out and come down to my hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>So I said I guess we&rsquo;d stick it out this time, but I&rsquo;d stay with
Andy the next trip.</p>
<p>But next morning Uncle Steve had another solution figured
out. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you stay at the Mountain View next time, Rel Maples and
me will be sore. If you stay at the Gatlinburg Inn, me and Andy
Huff will be sore. If you stay here again, the other two will be sore.
So I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to build a fourth hotel before you get back,
so you can have a place to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it would be nice if Uncle Steve built a hotel and gave
it to me to run. I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about nothin&rsquo; either, very
much. So I&rsquo;d be bound to make a success.</p>

<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Nov. 2, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<h3 id="c28">CADES COVE</h3>
<p>In a desperate effort,
I presume, to make up for his outrageous misjudgment of my walking
prowess, Assistant Chief Ranger Harold Edwards devoted his
weekly day of rest to showing me some of the interior of the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park.</p>
<p>We drove over to Cade&rsquo;s Cove in the far western end of the
park. Cade&rsquo;s Cove is several thousand acres of flat farm land set
right down in the middle of the Smoky Mountain chain. Its floor
is at 1800 feet elevation, and mountains ring it on every side.</p>
<p>In the old days, the people of Cade&rsquo;s Cove lived in a Shangri
La almost as isolated as a Tibetan monastery. They sent almost
nothing to market. They made their own clothes, ground their own
meal, butchered their own meat.</p>
<p>Only one road ran into Cade&rsquo;s Cove, and it was a pretty bad
road until the park and the CCC got hold of it. Even today it winds
and twists down over the pass to the tune of 200 hairpin turns. It
isn&rsquo;t a scary road at all, just a crooked one.</p>
<p>Some families left the Cove when the Government took over,
but 19 families remain. They have cars and trucks and tractors,
and a school and a store and even a post office with an R. F. D.
carrier. They are still pretty much their own world.</p>
<p>But Mr. Edwards comes from the Montana mountains, and he
is nuts about flat land.</p>
<p>You know those little two-pronged stickers that come off onto
your clothes by the hundreds when you walk through the weeds
in the fall. In Indiana we always called them Spanish needles. Here
in the mountains they call them &ldquo;beggar&rsquo;s lice.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c29">&lsquo;HEARTS-A-BUSTIN&rsquo; WITH LOVE&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Miss Laura Thornburgh lives in Gatlinburg and loves the
Smokies so much she&rsquo;s written a book about them. One evening she
sent us over a beautiful bouquet of Hearts-a-Bustin&rsquo;-with-Love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that one stops you. It is a local shrub, or hedge, or
flower, or tree. I don&rsquo;t know what you call it. Anyway it looks
like Christmas holly at first glance. But when you get up close,
you see it has been a round pod, and then it has broken open and
out have come four red berries, just like lights on a chandelier. It
is lovely.</p>
<p>The real name of it is Wahoo, but around here it is always
called &ldquo;Hearts-a-Bustin&rsquo;-with-Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the day that America registered for conscription, the Park
Service set up its counter and registered all travelers and wayfarers
and residents of the Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>One Ranger had to hike five miles back into the mountain
wilderness to register a boy who had been crippled since childhood
with infantile paralysis. There is no road back there, only a foot
trail.</p>
<p>I have a sneaking feeling that if this young man had never
been registered at all, nobody would have gone to the penitentiary
over it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be as astonished by some of the local expressions as the
discoverers would like you to be. The mountaineers say &ldquo;shoe
lastes&rdquo; for &ldquo;shoe last,&rdquo; and they say &ldquo;you&rsquo;uns,&rdquo; and &ldquo;heerd,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;poke&rdquo; for sack, and &ldquo;whistle pig&rdquo; for groundhog, and &ldquo;ketched&rdquo;
for caught, and so on.</p>
<p>Yet when I was a boy in Indiana there were people within
three miles of us who talked that way. And I have cousins back
home (nice people too) who say &ldquo;you-uns&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rsquo;uns&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ketched.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have to go out of the family to dig up a little
picturesque grammar. In fact, I don&rsquo;t even have to go out of the
room.</p>

<h3 id="c31">A GOOD BEAR STORY</h3>
<p class="center">Copyright 1947 by Wm. Sloane Associates, Inc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Special permission to re-print this bear story was granted by Wm. Sloane
Associates, Inc., of New York City, Publishers of &ldquo;Home Country&rdquo;, by Ernie
Pyle, which book contains this story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uncle Steve Cole lives
on at his old home place, right in the park. He is a typical mountain
man of the old school&mdash;a good mountain man, the kind who lives
right and does right.</p>
<p>I dropped in one afternoon to talk to him. Uncle Steve lit a
fire, and sat down beside it and began spitting in the fireplace. He
wasn&rsquo;t chewing tobacco, but he spit in the fireplace all the time
anyhow.</p>
<p>Uncle Steve had killed more bears than any man in these mountains.
He says so himself, and others say so too. He hasn&rsquo;t the remotest
idea how many he has killed. But he has killed bears with
muzzle-loaders, modern rifles, deadfalls, clubs, axes, and he even
choked one to death with his bare hands.</p>
<p>I got him to tell me that story. He and a neighbor went out
one night. The dogs treed a bear. The way Uncle Steve tells it
would take half an hour, and that&rsquo;s too long for us. But the essence
of it was that they built a fire, the bear finally came down the tree.
Uncle Steve stood there until the bear&rsquo;s body was pressing on the
muzzle of the gun, and then he pulled the trigger. &ldquo;I figured I
couldn&rsquo;t miss that way,&rdquo; Uncle Steve laughs.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t miss, but the shot didn&rsquo;t kill the bear. He ran 50
yards or so, and then the dogs were on him. And the first thing
Uncle Steve knew the bear had clenched his great jaws right down
on a dog&rsquo;s snoot, and was just crushing it to pieces.</p>
<p>Now Uncle Steve&rsquo;s gun was an old-fashioned, sawed-off muzzle-loading
hog rifle, and he didn&rsquo;t have time to reload it. So to save
the dog, he just rushed up to the bear from behind, put his legs
around the bear, and started prying the dog&rsquo;s snoot out of the
bear&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before I knew what happened,&rdquo; says Uncle Steve, &ldquo;the
bear let go of the dog, and got my right hand in his mouth, and
began a-crunchin&rsquo; and a-growlin&rsquo; and a-eating on my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One long tooth went right through the palm of my hand,
and another went through the back of my hand. There wasn&rsquo;t
nothin&rsquo; for me to do but reach around with my left hand for the
bear&rsquo;s throat. I got him by the goozle and started clampin&rsquo; down.
Pretty soon he let go. Then I just choked him till he was deader&rsquo;n
4 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; Uncle Steve spit in the fireplace.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cole was sitting on the bed, listening. Nobody said anything
for a minute. Then Mrs. Cole chuckled and said, &ldquo;Four
o&rsquo;clock ain&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Uncle Steve didn&rsquo;t dignify her quibble with an answer. He
just spit in the fireplace again.</p>
<h3 id="c32">WILEY OAKLEY</h3>
<p>The most famous man in the Smokies, as far as visitors are
concerned, is Wiley Oakley. He is called &ldquo;The Roamin&rsquo; Man of the
Mountains.&rdquo; He is 55, and all his life he has just wandered around
through the Smokies.</p>
<p>He is a natural woodsman, with a soul that sings in harmony
with the birds and the trees and the trees and the clouds. His English
is spectacular, and on many things he is as naive as a baby. But
on other things he almost shocks you with his meticulous knowledge.</p>
<p>He has a house in the hills, and a rustic-craft shop in Gatlinburg.
Most of his life he has made a living as guide to hunters, and
later to tourists. There are industrialists by the score in America
who worship at Wiley Oakley&rsquo;s feet after a few days in the mountains
with him.</p>
<p>He is a famous teller of tall tales (but he won&rsquo;t tell one on
Sunday). He has been on the radio, and on one trip to New York
was offered a contract. It scared him so badly he took the train
home without saying goodbye.</p>
<p>Throughout his wandering, Wiley has dropped past home often
enough to raise a dozen children. They are all grown now, except
one.</p>
<p>Wiley himself has run the same cycle as his beloved mountains.
In the beginning they were virginal, untouched, natural. But
now they have become public characters&mdash;both the mountains and
Wiley&mdash;before the curious eyes of a million people a year.</p>
<p>Maybe they have both been changed a little by it; a little
professionalism has come to them both. But that&rsquo;s all right. For
what good would the Smokies be, or Wiley Oakley either, if they
remained under a bushel?</p>
<h3 id="c33">SEES MUSEUM</h3>
<p>One of the places a visitor to Gatlinburg must see is the
Mountaineer Museum. This is a collection of some 2000 old-fashioned
mountain articles, gathered by Edna Lynn Simms.</p>
<p>Mrs. Simms came from Knoxville 24 years ago. She herself
roamed the mountains long before the tourists came. She picked
up articles, and lore, and the language of the hills. She has a
bubbling enthusiasm for everything she sees or hears, an enthusiasm
that has not begun to simmer down even after 24 years of
mountain discovery.</p>
<p>Mrs. Simms&rsquo; museum is the best collection of mountain stuff
in the Smokies. And in her own head is one of the finest collections
of mountain speech and legend. Why, she has quoted so long that
she talks like a mountain woman herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">GATLINBURG, Tenn., Nov. 5, 1940&mdash;</span></h2>
<p>This, I&rsquo;m sure you will
be relieved to know, is the last of the columns on the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park.</p>
<p>This is the biggest and best known National Park east of the
Mississippi. Its mountain mass is the highest in the East; its people
are as picturesque as any left in America.</p>
<p>And yet friends here say that on their trips out West, and
even down below in their own deep South, they frequently talk
with people who have never heard of the Smokies.</p>
<p>But that can never happen again. After the current mass of
words which this column has fired into the air, anybody who never
heard of the Smokies will have to be jailed as a fifth-columnist.
This is the final warning.</p>
<h3 id="c35">HEAD MAN</h3>
<p>The head man of the Great Smokies Park is Ross Eakin. His
men say he has one of the smoothest-working organizations in the
Park Service. He has been in charge here from the start. Before
that he was superintendent at Glacier, and at Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>The Smokies have been fortunate in having the CCC and the
WPA. Without them to do the work and do it cheaply, the Park
Service would have been decades reaching its present advanced
stage of improvements.</p>
<p>They have built hundreds of miles of trail, and fire roads for
trucks, and camping grounds and bridges and even beautiful stone
buildings for Park Headquarters, at one time there were 17 CCC
camps in the park, and even now there are seven.</p>
<p>The park does have, it seems to me, one definite lack. And
that is enough Rangers for direct contact with the public. The park
charges no admission, so you are not stopped or given information
when you drive in.</p>
<p>The public&rsquo;s hunger for authentic information is expressed in
the experience of one of the Rangers. When he first came here, he
took a rustic cottage in a tourist court, right in town, but every
evening the tourists would see him come home from work in his
uniform, and from then till bed time there was a line at his door.
He finally had to move.</p>
<h3 id="c36">DRIVEN AROUND</h3>
<p>Both Assistant Chief Ranger Harold Edwards, on the Tennessee
side, and Assistant Chief Ranger James Light, on the Carolina side,
have driven us all around through the interior of the park on fire
roads&mdash;gravel truck trails not open to the public.</p>
<p>We enjoyed these trips, yet as far as I can see, the most spectacular
views in the Park are available right from the cross-park
highway, or from the trails out of Gatlinburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>A horse trail follows the backbone of the high mountain
ridge from one end of the park to the other. This is a part of the
Appalachian Trail which runs from Maine to Georgia. Each summer
large groups come and ride the whole 71 miles of this trail, camping
out at night, taking a week or more for the journey.</p>
<p>There is one place on this trail, called Charlie&rsquo;s Bunion, which
I have not yet seen. It is a place where you ride or walk (or crawl
if you&rsquo;re like me) across a narrow, wind-swept ledge where it
drops straight off for 1500 feet. There aren&rsquo;t many such places in
the Smokies, but this one is a lulu.</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s Bunion is only a four-mile hike from the main paved
highway that crosses the Park. Some day, if my game knee ever
gets fully recovered, I&rsquo;ll have to hike up there and peek over the
edge. I hope my knee never gets better.</p>
<h3 id="c37">MANY MOVED</h3>
<p>When the Smokies became Government land, a great many
people were moved out. But also a great many were left in. Today
there are around 400 native mountain people still living in the
Tennessee half of the park, probably an equal number on the Carolina
side.</p>
<p>But it is hard for them. They are no longer masters of their
own souls. His independence is a mountain man&rsquo;s staff of life, and
the reason he was here in the first place.</p>
<p>Today a mountain man in the park dare not go hunting. He
can&rsquo;t even have a gun, unless he&rsquo;s a trusted old-timer allowed to
keep it for sentimental reasons.</p>
<p>He cannot trap. He cannot cut down a tree. He dare not cut
balsam boughs for an outdoor bed. When a mountain schoolteacher
wants to give some of the boys a whuppin&rsquo;, he has to get a Park
Warden to cut the switches for him.</p>
<p>The mountain people live within the shell of their traditional
existence, but it is an empty shell. The spirit has gone out of the
old log house; an unseen guard stands watch at the door over their
liberties. They are gradually leaving.</p>
<p>It is impossible both to retain, and to exhibit publicly, a natural
way of living. Two more generations, and the old mountain culture
of the Smokies will live only in the museums and the empty
log cabins with Government signs on them, and in the schools that
teach the newly educated youngsters how to weave and spin and
hew as their forefathers did. That&rsquo;s all that will be left.</p>
